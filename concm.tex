\chapter{Conclusions}
%Unlike traditional cyber-systems, the IoT systems can be affected due to the compromise of 
%the physical functioning of actuators. 
Badly designed apps, undesirable interactions between installed apps and/or {\color{black}device/communication failures} can cause an IoT system to transition into bad states. In this paper, we design and prototype a framework \sys that 
uses model checking as a basic building block to identify causes for bad physical/cyber states 
and provides counter-examples to exemplify these causes.
\sys addresses practical challenges such as alleviating state space
explosion with model checking, and automatic translation of app code into a form
amenable for model checking. %and is applicable to today's IoT systems. 
Our evaluations show
%case its effectiveness by evaluating it with 150 smart apps in SmartThings' market place and 25 malicious apps created by ContexIoT \cite{Jia:contexiot}. 
that \sys \textcolor{black}{identifies many (sometimes complex) unsafe configurations}, 
and 
{\color{black}flags considered bad apps with 100\% accuracy.}
