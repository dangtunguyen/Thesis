\chapter{Configuration Extractor}
\label{sec:extractor}

IoT platforms typically provide a mobile companion app and/or a web-based app
to manage and configure smart apps and devices.
For Samsung SmartThings, we develop a crawler in Java,
using the \href{https://jsoup.org/}{\textit{Jsoup}} package to automatically extract the system's
configuration from the management web app~\cite{Samsung:smartthingsmanage}.
Given a SmartThings account (user's name and password),
the crawler logs in to the management web app
and extracts (i) installed devices, (ii) installed smart apps, and
(iii) configurations of apps.
%We also provide users with an interface to select the list of safety properties (more details in \S~\ref{sec:desiredproperty}) they need verified. 
Moreover, whenever a user installs a new generic smart device (\eg, a smart power outlet),
we have an interface to get the device association info (\eg, this new outlet is used to control an AC) from the user.
The extracted configuration is then saved to a file and used later by the \textit{Model Generator}.
The process is straightforward and we omit the details in the interest of space.
